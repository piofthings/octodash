# OctoDash
A dashboard for your Octopus Energy data. I am doing this as an exercise to polish up my .Net Core skills.
Key Goals
- Build an API and OpenAPI docs for it.
- Build a testable core logic
- Build a lightweight database layer

# `octo-api` an API layer of your own

# `octo-get` The console host that runs `octo-link`

# `octo-link` The HttpClient that talks to Octopus Energy API

# `octo-web` The web frontend and actual dashboard <TBD>
